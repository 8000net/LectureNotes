    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative adversarial networks were first introduced in 2014. These models are comprised of two networks, the generator and the discriminator (or adversary). The generator produces images and the discriminator estimates if each image came from the generator or the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be viewed as a forgery detection task where the generator is making forgeries and the discriminator is learning how to detect forgeries. The objective is to have the discriminator detecting forgeries 50% of the time, or choosing randomly if the image is real or forged. As training goes on, the discriminator learns better and better how to deteck fakes, and the generator improves at fooling the discriminator.\n",

    "## 2014 -  Generative Adversarial Nets.\n",
    "GANs were first introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow and a team of researchers at the University of Montreal. They showed that this two-model system could be used to train models of opposite, but related tasks. In their work, the implemented the generator and the discriminator as simple multi-layer perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "They based the loss function off of a two-player minmax game function where the discriminator is trying to maximize its score (correct forgery detections) and the generator is trying to minimize its score (forgery detections).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $G$ is the generator, $D$ is the discriminator, $x$ is the training data, and $z$ is noise. This is quite different from traditional deep learning models where the objective is to minimize some value. With generative adversarial networks, we are instead trying to balance the performance of the two networks without letting one dominate the other. This can make them difficult to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid overfitting the discriminator, model training alternated between adjusting the discriminator and the generator. Specifically, the discriminator would update for $k$ steps before switching and updating the generator for one step.\n",

    "# GAN DeepFake Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent controversial work has been used to transfer the face of one subject to another. One particular implementation made its rounds on the internet as a way of taking a celebrity's face and putting it on content images or video frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models show how machine learning is being used for nefarious applications. It would therefore be useful to have a model that is capable of determining whether an image of a celebrity is genuine or has been generated by a faceswap model.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are an obvious candidate for this task because of their uses for forgery detection. The generator would forge faceswap images and the descriminator would learn how to detect if the picture is a real photo of someone or if it has been faceswapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN Detection\n",
    "To examine the performance of GAN faceswap detection, a simple CNN classifer is used to classify the real and fake images. The input data is a set of 4,000 real images and 10,000 images that have already had the face swapped. The swapped images have been swapped to new people and back to the original person. Additionally, some of the real images have been scaled down a random percentage to simulate someone moving further away from the web cam.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trained on real and a variety of fake images, the CNN is able to detect fake images with ~70% accuracy.\n",
